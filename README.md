 This is the world of business process automation. There many ways to achieve business automation. One of the way achieve a business process automation is creating a chat bot, which uses NLP/CNN and provides answer to the question. Some of use cases which pops up like HR business process automation, Banking Payment interaction automatio, Health Insurance claim adjudication process automation etc etc. These chat bots perform best if they are treated like a normal asset of company. But that, it means, give them the power of data to these robots and provide them deep learning algorithm to excel. But hard it is to build such architecture & robots. Check out my github project, which does the following:
 1. Tells you a joke
 2. Give TopN wikipedia pages
 
 This chat bot is build using:
 1. Spring Boot
 2. Slack
 3. Kafka
 4. Druid
 
 Also, the Gonnect Chatter box also reveals:
 Conversation AI = NLP + CNN + REST API
 
 NOTE: To keep things simple, a basic text recognition is build
