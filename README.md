# Gonnect Chatter

 This is the world of business process automation. There are many ways to achieve business automation. One of the way to achieve a business process automation is by creating a chat bot, which learn's using NLP/CNN. Some of use cases where bots can be used are:
  1. HR business process automation
  2. Banking Payment interaction automation
  3. Health Insurance claim adjudication process automation etc etc. 
  
  These chat bots perform best if they are treated like a normal asset of a company. By that, I mean, give them the power of data to the bot which will use deep learning algorithm to perform there duties. How hard it can be to build such architecture & for these bots. 
  
  Check out my github chat bot project, which does the following:
 1. Tells you a joke
 2. Give TopN wikipedia pages use real time streaming
 
 This chat bot is build using:
 1. Spring Boot
 2. Slack
 3. Kafka
 4. Druid
 5. Docker
 
 To summarize:
 
 Chat bot = Conversation AI = NLP + CNN + REST API
 
 NOTE: To keep things simple, a basic text recognition is build
 
 Below picture shows a sample reference architecture of chat bot:
